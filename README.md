# seminar_paper
This repository contains the code I used to produce the output of my seminar paper "forecasting house prices in Ames, Iowa by means of tree methods", Summer Term 18.

In order to reproduce the results of my seminar paper, the random states I used are also uploaded in the '500_random_states.csv' file. These are generated by a random number generator with python. The random states are strictly used in the order they are displayed in this file (e.g. for 200 random splits/trees I used the first 200 entries of the csv file).

The slides of my presentation can be accessed through the file "Forecasting_House_prices.pdf". Unfortunately there is only a German version available.
